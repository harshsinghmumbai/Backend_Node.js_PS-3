 # List of Concepts learned through this repo of Backend_Node.js_PS-3 such as:-

 <h2> 1. Express Generator</h2>
   <li>
     Express Generator is a tool that quickly creates the basic structure or "scaffolding" for a new Express.js project.
   </li>
   <li>
     Think of it like a template or a blueprint that helps you get started quickly without having to set everything up from scratch.
   </li>
   <li>
     It generates the folders and files you need to start building an Express.js application.

   <li>
     It sets up basic things like routing (how the website moves from one page to another), middleware (extra features like logging or error handling), and templating (how 
     the website is displayed).
   </li>
 
 <h2>2. What is Database</h2>

  <h2>3.What is models</h2>
  <li>
     Models are like simplified versions or representations of something more complex. They help us understand, explain, or predict how things work.
  </li>
  <li>
    Models help us understand complex things by breaking them down into simpler parts.
  </li>

  <h2>3. What is Scehma</h2>

  <h2>4. What is Collection </h2>

  </li>
  <li>
    collections are like containers that hold groups of items or data, and they're a fundamental concept in programming and data management

</li>
<li>
  Sessions are used to remember user-specific information, like login status or shopping cart contents, as the user navigates through a website.
</li>

<h2>7. creating sessions using sessions across routes and destroying in Code is below </h2>
